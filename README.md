## About myQSA
myQSA is a work-in-progress web application built on the Laravel framework to help Scouts in Hampshire complete their Queen's Scout Award.
Similar to eDofE, the Duke of Edinburgh's Award online portal, myQSA serves as a portal to track
the progress of participants and help them understand what they need to do to finish the award. It also aims to provide better
statistics for volunteers in Hampshire, so they know how to best support those attempting to complete the award.
